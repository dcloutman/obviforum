RELEASE NOTES: v0.0.1

The goal of this release is to have a demo-able, minimal viable product. This 
release should be secure enough to use in a light production environment, but it
will lack many of the features on might like to have in a Web forum. v0.0.1 will 
absolutely NOT be forward compatible with any future release and there will be no 
upgrade path from v0.0.1. No security released or support will be given for v0.0.1.


WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE. IT IS INTENDED FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES
ONLY. USE IN PRODUCTION AT YOUR OWN RISK.


CLONING THE REPOSITORY

You can download the current version of ObviForum from our git repository. The 
master branch should alwasy reflect the current release. The dev branch is unstable
and reflects work in progress. You should always download production software from
the master branch.


FUTURE PLANS:

The author is serious about getting this project into a working state, and devlopmen
of ObviFoum will continue. Plans are as follows:


Release 0.0.2 - Q2 2014

This release will not be backward compatible with the database from v0.0.1, and 
no upgrade path will be available. However, it is anticipated that upgrade
paths from this version to future versions will be available. The most noteworthy
new feature of this release will be the creation of topic specific boards, which 
will replace threads on the home page. The new hierarchy will be boards->threads->
posts.

ObviForum support should become self-hosting with this release.


Release 0.0.3, Release 0.0.4, and Release 0.0.5

These releases will include smaller product enhancements, leading up to a truly
feature-rich, production worthy open-source Web Forum.


Release 0.1.0

ObviForums will be production worthy at this point and will be actively promoted
as a Web-forum solution. User feedback will be gathered and intermediate releases
will be planned to fix bugs and add critical feature enhancements from the community.


Release 1.0.0

After implementing community feedback, ObviForum will be promoted as a hardened,
mainstream community Web forum platform. Broader community participation will
be solicited and commercial support may become available.
